; This file is a Stinkr XFILE that lists the program files that make up the
; shared C library.  It is used in the construction of a new library.  It
; is also used to construct test versions of programs not using the shared
; library and to construct timing versions of programs (which cannot use
; the shared library).

; The following are ITS- dependent files from C10LIB:

l c;c10cor
l c;c10exp
l c;c10fd
l c;c10fil
l c;c10fnm
l c;c10fo
l c;c10int
l c;c10io
l c;c10map
l c;c10mio
l c;c10pag
l c;c10sys
l c;c10tty

; The following are ITS-independent files from CLIB:

l c;ac
l c;alloc
l c;apfnam
l c;atoi
l c;blt
l c;cfloat
l c;cprint
l c;date
l c;fprint
l c;match
l c;pr60th
l c;random
l c;stkdmp
l c;string
l c;uuoh

; This must be last:

l c;c10run
