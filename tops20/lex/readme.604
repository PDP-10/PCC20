[6,4]	[.LEX]		Lexical Analyser Generator

This is an implementation of the Unix program LEX, which generates
lexical analysers from regular expression grammars.

Because the Decus compiler does not seperate I and D space, LEX
cannot be used to build very large grammars.   There are several
possibilities:

	1.	Remove the dfa/nfa print routines, which are needed
		for debugging.

	2.	Use I/O redirection to read the grammar source from
		stdin.  This will save 1/4 K-word or so.

	3.	Overlay the parser phases.

Have fun.
